# Face-recognition-app

App based on this repository: https://github.com/JDAI-CV/FaceX-Zoo/tree/main

Download it, then download these files and put them in the FaceX-Zoo/face_sdk/api_usage/

Install all the requirements from the requirements.txt.

The base repo uses CUDA, but it can be changed.

You'll also need to adjust the paths.

Have fun!
